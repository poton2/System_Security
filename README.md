**Stream Cipher**

I will XOR input stream with the given key "COMPUTER76543210" 

Encryption and decryption will be performed with the same module that you design for the Stream Cipher.

**Block Cipher**

The encryption would be a three step process : pad (if required) -> encrypt (using XOR) -> swap

 block size will be 128 bits
 
 The decryption process is also of three steps but proceeds in the reverse order as the encryption process : swap -> decrypt (using XOR) -> remove padding (if required).
 
**Mode**
 
 B for Block Cipher 
 S for Stream Cipher 
 E for encryption
 D for decryption
